        <h2>A Poem</h2>
     <h3>By Sanaa Lott</h3>   
    Feather flings, in the sky they sing<br>
        A voice that attracts all with a grin<br>
        A pure white creature as happy as can be<br>
        Jumped as their ears laid upon that melody<br>
        One little rabbit<br> 
        As small as a bean,<br> 
        hopped out of their comfy den for all to see<br>
        Unfortunate the rabbit didn't suspect,<br>  
        That the song would put him <i>right</i> under the Flings' trap<br>
        One dove at what seemed like the speed of light<br>
        Scooping at the little rabbit,<br>
        And vanished without a trace.<br>
        The mother screams for her child,<br>
        There was no use,<br>
        For the Feathered Flings will make sure,<br>
        Her baby will return with nothing more. <br>
